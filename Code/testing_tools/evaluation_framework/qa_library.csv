| **exposure_exposure** | parent-child | Hierarchy of environmental exposures. |

## 4. Technical Methodologies

### A. Disease Entity Resolution (Grouping)
To prevent ""noise,"" the researchers collapsed nearly **22,000** raw disease terms into **17,080** meaningful nodes.
* **The Problem:** Ontologies often have redundant terms for the same condition (e.g., ""Infantile Autism"" vs ""Autism, Infantile"").
* **The Solution:** Used **ClinicalBERT** (NLP Model) to calculate semantic similarity.
* **The Threshold:** Terms with a **cosine similarity ≥ 0.98** were merged into a single `node_index`.

### B. Multimodality (Features vs. Edges)
PrimeKG is a **multimodal** graph, meaning it uses two types of data:
1.  **Structural Edges:** Mathematical links (e.g., `Protein-A interacts-with Protein-B`) used for graph algorithms.
2.  **Textual Features:** Large blocks of text (descriptions, symptoms, epidemiology) from **Mayo Clinic** and **Orphanet** stored directly inside the disease nodes.

## 4. Technical Methodologies

### A. Disease Entity Resolution (Grouping)
To prevent ""noise,"" the researchers collapsed nearly **22,000** raw disease terms into **17,080** meaningful nodes.
* **The Problem:** Ontologies often have redundant terms for the same condition (e.g., ""Infantile Autism"" vs ""Autism, Infantile"").
* **The Solution:** Used **ClinicalBERT** (NLP Model) to calculate semantic similarity.
* **The Threshold:** Terms with a **cosine similarity ≥ 0.98** were merged into a single `node_index`.

### B. Multimodality (Features vs. Edges)
PrimeKG is a **multimodal** graph, meaning it uses two types of data:
1.  **Structural Edges:** Mathematical links (e.g., `Protein-A interacts-with Protein-B`) used for graph algorithms.
2.  **Textual Features:** Large blocks of text (descriptions, symptoms, epidemiology) from **Mayo Clinic** and **Orphanet** stored directly inside the disease nodes.
