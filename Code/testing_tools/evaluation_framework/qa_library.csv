* **The Threshold:** Terms with a **cosine similarity ≥ 0.98** were merged into a single `node_index`.

### B. Multimodality (Features vs. Edges)
PrimeKG is a **multimodal** graph, meaning it uses two types of data:
1.  **Structural Edges:** Mathematical links (e.g., `Protein-A interacts-with Protein-B`) used for graph algorithms.
2.  **Textual Features:** Large blocks of text (descriptions, symptoms, epidemiology) from **Mayo Clinic** and **Orphanet** stored directly inside the disease nodes.

## 5. Clinical Validation
The utility of PrimeKG was proven through a **Drug Repurposing Case Study**:
* **The Test:** Researchers checked the ""network distance"" between drugs and diseases they were approved for *after* the graph was built.
* **The Result:** In **80% of cases**, the drug was significantly closer to the disease in the graph than expected by random chance.
* **Conclusion:** This proves that PrimeKG can be used to predict which existing drugs might work for new diseases.
