## 2. Graph Schema & Node Definitions
PrimeKG categorizes biological and medical entities into 10 distinct node types.

| Node Type | Example Name | Meaning/Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **gene/protein** | `PHYHIP` | The functional units (genes/proteins) of the body. |

## 3. Relationship (Edge) Types
PrimeKG contains 30 types of relations. Unlike standard graphs, it distinguishes between how drugs and diseases interact.

### Clinical Relationship Mapping
### PrimeKG Relationship Reference Table

This table describes the 30 relationship types found in PrimeKG, their display names in the graph, and the biological or clinical meaning of each connection.

| **drug_drug** | synergistic interaction | When the combined effect of two drugs is greater than the sum of their separate parts. |
| **drug_effect** | side effect | Secondary, usually adverse, physical effects caused by a drug. |
| **drug_protein (target)** | target | The specific protein that a drug is designed to bind to for therapeutic effect. |
| **drug_protein (enzyme)** | enzyme | The protein (usually in the liver) responsible for metabolizing/breaking down the drug. |

| **disease_protein** | associated with | A genetic or molecular link where a protein's behavior is tied to disease onset. |
| **disease_disease** | parent-child | Hierarchical link (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes" is a child of "Diabetes Mellitus"). |
| **pathway_protein** | interacts with | Connects a protein to the biochemical pathway it "works" in. |
| **pathway_pathway** | parent-child | Hierarchical link between broad pathways and specific sub-pathways. |
| **bioprocess_protein** | interacts with | Links a protein to a specific biological goal (e.g., "Cellular Respiration"). |
| **bioprocess_bioprocess** | parent-child | Hierarchy of biological processes. |
| **molfunc_protein** | interacts with | Connects a protein to its specific molecular task (e.g., "DNA Binding"). |
| **molfunc_molfunc** | parent-child | Hierarchy of molecular functions. |
| **cellcomp_protein** | interacts with | Links a protein to the cellular structure where it is located (e.g., "Ribosome"). |
| **cellcomp_cellcomp** | parent-child | Hierarchy of cellular locations. |
| **anatomy_protein_present** | expression present | Indicates the protein is physically found in this specific organ or tissue. |
| **anatomy_protein_absent** | expression absent | Indicates the protein is specifically not expressed in this tissue. |
| **anatomy_anatomy** | parent-child | Anatomical hierarchy (e.g., "Aorta" is a child of "Circulatory System"). |
| **phenotype_protein** | associated with | Direct link between a clinical symptom and a specific protein's activity. |
| **phenotype_phenotype** | parent-child | Hierarchy of observable physical traits. |
| **exposure_disease** | linked to | Environmental stressors (toxins/chemicals) that can cause or trigger a disease. |
| **exposure_protein/molfunc/etc** | interacts with | How an environmental factor affects specific molecular or cellular components. |
| **exposure_exposure** | parent-child | Hierarchy of environmental exposures. |

## 4. Technical Methodologies

### A. Disease Entity Resolution (Grouping)
To prevent "noise," the researchers collapsed nearly **22,000** raw disease terms into **17,080** meaningful nodes.
* **The Problem:** Ontologies often have redundant terms for the same condition (e.g., "Infantile Autism" vs "Autism, Infantile").
* **The Solution:** Used **ClinicalBERT** (NLP Model) to calculate semantic similarity.
* **The Threshold:** Terms with a **cosine similarity ≥ 0.98** were merged into a single `node_index`.

### B. Multimodality (Features vs. Edges)
PrimeKG is a **multimodal** graph, meaning it uses two types of data:
1.  **Structural Edges:** Mathematical links (e.g., `Protein-A interacts-with Protein-B`) used for graph algorithms.
2.  **Textual Features:** Large blocks of text (descriptions, symptoms, epidemiology) from **Mayo Clinic** and **Orphanet** stored directly inside the disease nodes.

## 5. Clinical Validation
The utility of PrimeKG was proven through a **Drug Repurposing Case Study**:
* **The Test:** Researchers checked the "network distance" between drugs and diseases they were approved for *after* the graph was built.
* **The Result:** In **80% of cases**, the drug was significantly closer to the disease in the graph than expected by random chance.
* **Conclusion:** This proves that PrimeKG can be used to predict which existing drugs might work for new diseases.
