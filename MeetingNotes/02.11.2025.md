# Project Meeting

## Attendees
- Bahri Atay Özgövde
- Cengiz Bilal Sarı

## Topics
- Discussion on the project idea and desired outcomes
- Frameworks that we know and use for RAG-powered LLMs at the industry etc.
- Discussion on how project progress should be.

## Project Structure
- Key areas of focus are Vector Embedding, Vector Database, Chunking, and Testing.
- We have some gaps in our fundamental mathematical background on these topics, we will gain an understanding of the general structure through implementation.
- Implementation will be maintained via the GitHub repository.

## Action Items
- Initially, a simple RAG Pipeline will be built to familiarize with the stages.
- Users will upload a file via an interface, its embeddings will be saved to the database, there will be an automated test that can be run, and there will be a section for users to ask questions.
- A GitHub repository will be created. Meeting notes, code, and general documents will be kept there.
- The working principles of vector embeddings and tokenizers will be researched.
